          Cactuses are incredible household companions to people that don't have a lot of time to care for plants.
          This aspect comes from the fact that cactuses don't need no fancy soil. They thrive in poor soil. Also them
          being
          suculents means you shouldn't water them very often. Only thing that that you need to remember is to water
          them
          at
          all. For lazy person such as me, even this can prove to be a significant task.
          <br>
          Main reason to even keep such a plant is that when it has flowers, more often than not thay are quite
          spectacular.
          Also each cactus grows very different from the previous one, making interesting shapes in the process.
